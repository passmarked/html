The alt tag on a `<input>` is intended for inputs that display a image, such as a button. The alt tag allows users who are unable to view the image to view alternate text which will allow them to continue using the site.

If specified the alt tag must not be empty.

# How do I fix this ?

Remove the empty alt tag to confirm to the spec. Better yet specify the attribute if applicable for the input.
