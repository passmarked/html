Silverlight was introduced in 2007 by Microsoft as a way to create interactive in your browser using C#. Initially the platform gained a nice community but was abonded and deprecated in May of 2012, just a few years later, due to its lack of popularity.

Various vendors such as [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/za/) and [Amazon Video](http://www.amazon.com/video) have noted that they will be moving to HTML5 players instead once end of life was reached.

While it is still available for [download](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) to keep systems running it is not advised.

Having reached it's end of life, Silverlight might not receive the needed care and focus to ensure security does not become a problem. That along with newer browsers not taking a liking to plugins, Silverlight would not be a good pick for new projects.

# How do I fix this ?

Avoid using Silverlight for any functionality.

To ensure the highest level of usablility remove all Silverlight from a site (this includes ads) and look at using open standards like HTML5. 

HTML5 supports all (if not more) features that a common Silverlight environment provided and works accross all devices from Mobile to Desktop giving websites the largest audience to which they can cater.
