When using flash on a web page the big risk is that only a small number of users will be able to use the feature.

Users on mobile platforms like IOS are not able to use flash components. With newer browsers also opting to disable plugins.

Along with the aforementioned newer browsers will disable all functionality of Flash if the installed plugin is deemed too old. Meaning users who update slower will also not be able to your website.

# How do I fix this ?

Avoiding plugins like Flash have become a important step when looking at websites. 

To ensure the highest level of usablility remove all flash components from a site (this includes ads) and look at using open standards like HTML5. 

HTML5 supports all (if not more) features that a common flash environment provided and works accross all devices from Mobile to Desktop.
